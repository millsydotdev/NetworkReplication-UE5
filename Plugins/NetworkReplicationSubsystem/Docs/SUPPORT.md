## **FAQ**

### **Installation**
**Q: How do I install the plugin?**
A: See the INSTALLATION.md guide for detailed instructions. You can install via GitHub clone, manual installation, or package installation.

**Q: The plugin doesn't appear in my project.**
A: Ensure the plugin is in the correct location (`YourProject/Plugins/NetworkReplicationSubsystem/`) and that you've restarted the editor after installation.

**Q: I'm getting compilation errors.**
A: Check that all required dependencies are included in your project's `.Build.cs` file and that you have the correct UE version.

### **Usage**
**Q: How do I add replication to my character?**
A: Add the Network Replication Component to your character Blueprint or C++ class, then call the replication functions as needed.

**Q: Why isn't my replication working?**
A: Check that the actor has replication enabled, the component is properly registered, and you're calling the functions from the correct context.

**Q: How do I optimize performance?**
A: Use the replication settings to adjust frequency and distance, implement relevancy culling, and monitor bandwidth usage.

### **Troubleshooting**
**Q: Sounds aren't playing on other clients.**
A: Check that the sound asset is valid, the audio component exists, and the replication is being called from the correct context.

**Q: Animations aren't syncing.**
A: Verify that the anim instance exists, the montage asset is valid, and the character has proper setup.

**Q: Actors aren't spawning on other clients.**
A: Check that the actor class supports replication, the spawn parameters are correct, and the network settings are proper.

### **Performance**
**Q: How do I reduce bandwidth usage?**
A: Adjust replication settings, implement relevancy culling, use compression, and optimize the frequency of updates.

**Q: How do I improve performance?**
A: Use the built-in optimization features, implement custom relevancy logic, and monitor performance metrics.

**Q: How do I handle high latency?**
A: Use prediction systems, implement interpolation, and adjust replication settings for your network conditions.
